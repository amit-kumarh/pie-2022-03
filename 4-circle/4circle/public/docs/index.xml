      <description>Overview and Goals The primary software component of our project was an algorithm that could play the Connect 4 algorithm against our human player.
We wanted to make our algorithm as good at the game as possible, so we set our goal to build a perfect weak solver; that is, a solver that was capable of ensuring the best possible result from any situation, though not necessarily taking the shortest path to get there.</description>

      <description>For our mechanical system, we created a chip dispensing mechanism that was mounted on a lead screw attached to a stepper motor so that it could move to the correct column and dispense a chip into it. Almost all parts were 3D printed using PLA with the exception of the mount and box around the lead screw, which was laser cut on 1/4&amp;quot; MDF.
Chip Dispensing: To hold the chips prior to their dispensing, we 3-D printed a PLA tube that was mounted above the chute.</description>

      <description>To integrate our software and electrical components we used a simple Python script that could write to the serial port the arduino was connected to. To do this, we first needed to integrate Go and Python, such that our compiled Go program could call our Python program to write to serial.
Our first attempt at integration was trying to import C into Go, using the &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; package, and then using C&amp;rsquo;s Python/C API to run our Python code.</description>
