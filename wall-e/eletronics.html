                    </h2>
                    <p>Intelligent, speedy and powerful, electronic part is the heart of WALL-E. We equipped Wall-e with
                        two powerful dual-core esp32 processors as well as an arduino for body movement control. All
                        movements of WALL-E could be controlled by virtual controller integrated in user's smart phone
                        application, you may
                        drive it around the building and gain high quility real-time video streaming send back from
                        WALL-E remotely. For a better vision, you may also adjust horizontal angle of WALL-E's neck by
                        smart phone controller.

                        <p>There's a mini world inside the body of WALL-E. A 3D printed 3-layer stack is inside this
                            little guy's tummy. The top layer has two esp32,
                            one is the ESP32-CAM shooting live video and send back, the other one is used as a receiver
                            to connect user interface with body-control arduino. On the middle layer,
                            we have the 4 usb port battery to provide power for whole structure, two ESP32 and arduino
                            are directly plugged in the power bank.
                            While the ssd1306 display is powered and controlled by receiver ESP32, and servo connecterd
                            and powered by arduino. At the bottom layer,
                            there's an arduino stacked with a adafruit motorshield, receiving data from receiver esp32
                            and control all movements.

                        <p>Thanks to our meche crew, they have made a XL body and chassis for WALL-E. This version of
                            WALL-E XL could explore more complex
                            environment, and more stable. Due to the high power consumption of the large body, it cannot
                            work wirelessly, and could only work with 12V power adapter right now.
