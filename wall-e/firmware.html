                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>The firmware in this projected consisted of the Arduino controlling the 4 DC
                    motors and the stepper motor.
                </p>

                <h3>DC Motors</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>The DC Motors give us the ability to control the wheels and therefore the direction and velocity
                    of Wall-E. The Arduino sketch recieves messages through its input pins as signals. The signals
                    recieved
                    are from the ESP32. The signals are sent in the form of a 4 bit string, generating a usable message.
                    The possible codes are
                    1000,0100,0010, and 0001. Each message represents a different direction: forward, back, left, and
                    right.
                    The script constantly checks which signal it is receiving and updates the velocity of the wheels
                    to match the message.
                    1000, or forward, informs the wheels to have a positive velocity in the forward direction.
                    0100, or backward, informs the wheels to have a positive velocity in the backward direction.
                    0010, or left, informs the wheels on the right side to have a positive velocity in the forward
                    direction
                    and the wheels on the left have a positive velocity in the backward direction.
                    0001, or right, informs the wheels on the left side to have a positive velocity in the forward
                    direction
                    and the wheels on the right have a positive velocity in the backward direction.
                    With these four codes, we have complete control over the direction and velocity
                    of the car, thanks to our firmware.
                </p>

                <h3>Servo Motor</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>The Servo Motor gives us the ability to control the direction the camera is pointed in.
                    It utilizes the same signals as the DC motors. The code for the firmware of the stepper motor
                    is integrated within the code of the DC motors. This was a design choice so the running time
                    was lower and the actions were more in sync. Each time the script detects a left(0010) or
                    right(0001)
                    direction,
                    the script sends a signal to the servo motor. Once the signal is recieved, the servo
                    motor rotates 35 or -35 degrees. The servo is centered at 90 degrees. With a left signal,
                    it rotates -35 degrees, stopping at 55 degrees. When a right signal is recieved, it rotates
                    35 degrees, stopping at 125 degrees. When neither is detected it rotates back to 90 degrees,
                    which is pointing straight forward.
