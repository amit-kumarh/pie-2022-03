                    <p>A major goal for our project was to be as sustainable as possible.
                        This meant using scrap materials in the classroom from previous
                        projects to build most things in the rover. The body itself was
                        made by several trays of metal we found in one of the scrap bins.
                        They were not our ideal sizes, but we still decided to make use
                        of old scrap. Additionally, pieces used in the wheels were also
                        picked up from scrap bins. We are proud to say that most of our
                        rover is reused material. </p>

                    <h3 class="major">Chasis</h3>
                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>We wanted to design a chassis with a sleek design. We wanted minimal
                        protrusions as well as smooth sides. That said, we used scrap to
                        fabricate it so it was not as easy as we thought. We began with
                        the bottom of our rover. It was decided that the trays we chose
                        were slightly too long, so the piece had to be cut to size. Next,
                        we cut holes in the middle of the tray to cut down on weight. </p>
                    <img src="images/alcu.jpg" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
                    <img src="images/fulcu.jpg" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>

                    <p>We then moved onto walls. Because of all the rails and bends that the
                        scrap metal had, we had to ideate for days to figure out how to
                        cut these down to size and keep the sides smooth. We finally
                        decided on a design which required us to shorten and narrow down
                        the scrap trays as shown below.</p>
                    <img src="images/needcu.jpg" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
                    <img src="images/sidecu.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
                    <p>
                        To continue with our minimalist design, we decided
                        we wanted the motors to be inside the rover. After we 3D printed a
                        motor mount, we marked the chassis for drilling. We were able to
                        install the motors with only the motor axles sticking out of small
                        holes.</p>
                    <img src="images/mounts.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
                    <img src="images/instmo.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
                    <p> With this done, we simply added a lightweight layer on top
                        as a cover which doubled as a place to mount the camera. The camera
                        itself was connected to a motor that helped it pan left and right.
                        It also had a protective casing that also kept it sturdy while the
                        rover would move.</p>

                    <h3 class="major">Wheels</h3>
                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>With the chassis done, all we had left was the wheels. We looked for wheels
                        in the scrap bins, but no wheels were big enough for our rover. We had
                        to order some wheels using our budget. </p>
                    <img src="images/amawhee.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>

                    <p>These wheels, however, had a few
                        issues. The main issue was that they came with bearings. The secondary
                        issue was the weight of them. Thankfully, we were able to come up with
                        solutions. The bearings issue was solved by taking the bearings out.
                        This left a big hole in the middle of the wheel, so we took scrap metal
                        and melted it into the hole. This allowed us to have a foundation for a
                        3d printed piece that connected the wheel to the motor axles with a bolt.</p>
                    <img src="images/wheel.jpg" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
                    <p>
                        The weight issue was bypassed by shaving off what we could from the wheels
                        themselves. Since the inside of the wheel would be out of sight, we focused
                        on chipping away at that. </p>


                    <h3 class="major">Neck</h3>
                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>One of our mechanisms that required lots of ideation was the neck
                        mechanism. Initially, we wanted to create a more complex design like the
                        one seen below.</p>
                    <img src="images/rene.png" alt="alternatetext" width=17% height=17%>
                    <p>However, we quickly realized that a simpler neck was more viable. We
                        decided to have a servo motor as the base of the neck, allowing it to pan
                        left and right. In order to attach the camera to the neck, we also needed
                        to 3D print a case for the camera which also doubled as a protective box.</p>
