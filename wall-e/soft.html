                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The software program for WALL-E basically have three parts, ESP32-CAM, Blynk control-ESP32 receive,
                    Drive&Neck and FAcial expression. All development work
                    could be doen with arduino IDE. With support of ESP32 third party board driver and libraries.
                </p>

                <h3>Blynk</h3>
                <p>Blynk is an IoT application for multi platforms. Each little program has its own authentication key
                    and you could design your own user interface inside its application.
                    After setting it up, you will need to match the data stream, for example, joystick used merged
                    datastream, chosse V3 for data type. For testing purpose, we also desined
                    a serial read program for digit reading, please refer to the link below. At first we also tried
                    Wemos D1R1 wifi board for Blynk control receiver.
                    But due to the low power efficiency and unstability, we switched to stable esp32. Please notice,
                    some pins on ESP32 are already connected top its on-board flash memory, you cannot use
                    them for digital input or output.
                </p>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    After transmitting data to ESP32, it will process and pass data to arduino(Movement control) in form
                    of a four-digit binary number
                    For eample(forward 1000, Backward 0100, Left 0010, right 0001)
                </p>

                <h3>ESP32-CAM</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>The ESP32 CAM uses high resolution OV2640 camera for video shooting. After flashing the code into
                    ESP32-CAM, it will automatically connect to the
                    network with written in information. PLease open serial monitor after flashing, IP address of CAM
                    will be listed. Log into the ip address within the same network(so that you don't need NAT), There's
                    neat and clean page for video send back. Face detection and recognition are based on pretrained
                    models.

                <h3>Drive and Neck</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Motorshield and neck's are build on the code for both MP2 and MP3, used adafruit motorshield library
                    to implement drive code for four wheels. You may want to have a look on merged code, see below.</p>

                <h3>Face</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Facial expression of WALL-E is ddeveloped on ssd1306 display, refresh to switch between differenbt
                    bitmaps, for more details and development history, please refer to the link below.
